<h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
<p>
Mindfulness, in a nutshell, is paying close attention to your and others' emotions, on purpose and non-judgmentally.
Through applying mindfulness we can develop high-resolution awareness of emotions as they arise.
We can detect our emotions by paying close attention to the body.
Emotional skills are just as important as technical skills (absolutely).
Emotional skills are trainable (because the brain is awesome and plastic!)
</p>

<h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
<p>
  One of my biggest weaknesses is maintaining focus when I carry out tasks, particularly ones which require me to do one thing for a long time (e.g. watching a video or reading something). So, being aware of that and practicing to bring my attention back as I was watching the video was helpful. I liked Meng's analogy of the practice of bringing one's attention back to the task, like working out a muscle; the more you do it the stronger the brain becomes at it.
