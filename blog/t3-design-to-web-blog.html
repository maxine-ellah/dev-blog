    <h3>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important</h3>

    <p>A responsive site is a website that can be viewed on any device with any sized screen. Responsiveness provides flexibility to the layout of a website so that however you resize your browser screen, the content shrinks and expands within the boundaries of the screen size. It also provides adjustability to a site allowing different parts of content to move around depending on the screen size.</p>

    <h3>What mobile first design is, and why it's important</h3>
    <p>This is when you start designing your site with a small or mobile screen in mind, rather than a larger (e.g.) desktop screen. Desgning like this is really beneficial because it is much easier to distribute content in a readable way when going from a small space to a big one, rather than vice versa.</p>

    <h3>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons</h3>

    <p>Frameworks are a package of already structured files and folders containing standardised code. They are usually used at the beginning of the creation of a site because they contain alot of common structures already in use in webpages today, meaning you don't have to code your webpage from scratch.</p>
    <p>To me, however, it seems like the biggest disadvantage of using frameworks is that you can easily get used to using them and be less creative when creating your webpage. I get the whole 'there's no need to reinvent the wheel' thing, but sometimes I think it's good to go into things with the abmition to reinvent it, even if you don't. Especially when you're a total newbie like me!</p>

    <h3>What a wireframe is and why we use it</h3>

    <p>A wireframe is essentially a drawing or sketch of your webpage not including any design elements. Like the skeleton of your webpage. Drawing wireframe allows you to visually map out the heirarchical structure of your website and to play around with where things will go. It is also very important for communicating your ideas with clients. By showing them a wireframe a client is able to understand the funtionality of the page without being distracted by things like font, colour, sizing etc. which you will add later in the develoment process anyway. The wireframe can of course also be used as the template for the design process.</p>

    <h3>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why</h3>
    <p>Definitely positioning. Honestly, I still don't really understand how to do this very well. Hence why my images above aren't positioned! I did manage to position an element beside another one on my index page but it was kind of a fluke. 'display:flex' is still very temperamental when I try to use it.</p>
