    <h1>Leadership</h1>
    <h2>13 March 2016</h2>

    <h3>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h3>

    <p>The way I understand a compassionate leader is a leader who puts the wellbeing of the people in their team first, and, I know it sounds really bad, but I think the majority of managers I've had (to use the workplace as an example) have been totally out of touch with that concept. In a way, I understand it because so often they themselves have had to report to pretty intense managers and consistently deliver a high level of results, and I think this constant preassure to deliver good results no matter what is not conducive to creating a pleasant, low stress work environment. 
    I think, in the highly heirarchical work environments the are present today, compassionate leadership can only be expected if it infiltrates all levels of leadership.</p>
     
    <h3>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h3>

    <p>It was quite nice, helped me calm down after a stressful day at work, talking to occaisionally soul-destroying customers all day. I really like and often (but not often enough) try to revert to thinking about the goodness in others. Someone once said to me, they don't ever feel jealous or envious when they see a really beautiful person, because instead of feeding off such a horrible feeling, they see the  choose to feed off that persons 'goodness' and said it makes them feel just as good or worthy as that super hot good looking person. And, as a result it makes them feel beautiful . Doing this exeercise reminded me of that a bit, in that if you can see something good in a person, that perhaps you wish you had, to reframe things and see it as goodness which  you can benefit from that 'goodness' too and it makes you feel good. </p>
     
    <h3>Do the tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
    <p>In all honesty, I didn't do this one because this weekend's been a wee bit stressful and the thought of imagining people's badness didn't really appeal to me. I definitely want to try it at some point, but I know myself well enough that if I do it when I already feeling a little down, it'll stay with me all day.</p>

    <h3>How does the SCARF model apply to your phase-0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h3>

    <p>In all honesty, this made no sense to me. By that, I mean these 5 'domains' don't really feel all that relevant to me and my life. The only one that felt like it could be applicable was status. Status, I think of as a relative thing. Like how people perceive themselves, compared to others and ones' abilities. I really didn't relate to the idea of status threats being so impactful and so easily triggered. I think I view myself in this comparative way quite frequently, and I observe people around me doing it to. To be honest I really don't think it's helpful because it's kind of irrelevant to compare yourself to others and can get in the way of focusing on yourself and your own journey. I did really like the idea of 'playing against yourself' and increasing mastery to increase status in your head. It's a bit crazy sounding but I can imagine it being quite helpful for me in the phase-1 in confidence building when I'm feeling a bit self-concious about my abilities.</p>


    <h3>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h3>
    <p>Yep had one.</p>
