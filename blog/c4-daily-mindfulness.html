What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?
He liked being able to talk everything out without having to stop and just have someone listen.
It was good but a bit awkward only having 3 minutes. I was very aware of the time as I was talking. I felt like I only scratched the surface of what I was talking about. I might do this more often, for longer amounts of time.

Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
I'd like to continue with the mindfulness conversations.

Any other musings?
I appreciate the value of reflection and mindfulness when doing this course, I just find it hard to get the most out of it when my time is so limited and stress levels are high.
