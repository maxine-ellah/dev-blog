    <h1>Daily Mindfulness</h1>
    <h2>7 February 2016</h2>

<h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>
<p>He liked being able to talk everything out without having to stop and just have someone listen.
For me, it was good but a bit awkward only having 3 minutes. I was very aware of the time as I was talking. I felt like I only scratched the surface of what I was talking about. I might do this more often, for longer amounts of time.</p>

<h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
<p>I'd like to continue with the mindfulness conversations.</p>

<h3>Any other musings?</h3>
<p>I appreciate the value of reflection and mindfulness when doing this course, I just find it hard to get the most out of it when my time is so limited and stress levels are high.</p>
