<h3>In the javascript language, describe all the use cases for each of:</h3>

 <h3>parentheses () - e.g. '1. Execute a function var result = doSomething()'</h3>
 <p>Parentheses are used to pass parameters through a function which takes the parameters, does something to them and creates (or returns) a new value. They are also used to structure expressions and create an order for what will be executed first (a bit like order of operation/BODMAS in maths).</p>
 
 <h3>brackets []</h3>
 <p>These are used in arrays (lists) with the contents of the array being inside the brackets. Brackets are also used when defining objects using bracket notation, which looks like this: 

 var music = [
 "rap": "kanye",
 "rnb":"frank ocean",
 "classical":"Chopin"
 ];

music["rnb"] returns the value "frank ocean" in the "music" array.</p>

<h3>Braces {}</h3>
<p>Braces are mainly indicators of what will happen if a condition is met (in e.g. and if statement) or in a function. Whatever code is inside the curly braces will run, as long as parameters are given to a function or if, while, else or else if statements are true.</p>

 <h3>single quotes '' & double quotes ""</h3>
 <p>From what I have learned so far there doesn't seem to be a difference between using one or the other. However, I have just read on stackoverflow that double quotes MUST be used in JSON objects.</p>
