    <h2>14 January 2016</h2>
    <h3>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience? </h3>

    <p>So far the experience has been a combination of wracked nerves, excitement, self-doubt and a couple-self high fives.
      
    </p>
    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>

    <p>
      It's already very evident that being successful in this course and getting the most out of it depends almost completely on the individual and them taking the learning experience into their own hands. For me, just from creating this website, I have run into lots of annoying little roadblocks which I've had to work through and overcome feelings of discouragement and ask for help. It's cool to see that persistence (which I'm not usually very good at) benefit me and my work. 
    </p>

    </h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? </h3>
    <p>
      I'm not terribly accustomed to working in a group environment, however, I am very excited to get to know my cohort and learn from them. 
      I really like that empathy is something which is valued in the culture, because it's how I get to know others and relate to others. So I think, in some ways, it will be completely diving into something new and unfamiliar, and in others, I will feel comfortable in my ability to connect and getting to know others. 
    </p>

    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? </h3>

    <p>
     No, they have not really changed that much. I came into the course knowing I would have to leave my comfort zone and do things I've never even thought of doing, so I think this first week has already cemented that!
    </p>

   <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3> 

    <p>
     I'm definitely excited because, although it's new to me, I'm starting to see the benefits of learning in this type of environment. And I'm definitely nervous because I know I'm going to feel insecure about my technical abilities, but I'm going to try and challenge myself not to!
