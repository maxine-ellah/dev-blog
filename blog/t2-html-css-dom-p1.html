<h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
<p>I know cake has already been used, but since food is one thing I really understand I'm going to use this analogy too!
Your webpage is like a rich chocolate cake with lots of chocolate icing on top. The structure of the cake is created with things like flour, baking powder and eggs, these help the cake to rise and give it shape and structure - this is your HTML.
I'd say the oven is the DOM. This allows all the elements/ingredients to work together to produce the finished product. 
The CSS would be the chocolate icing you pour on top to make your cake look (and smell) amazing. CSS allows you to give your webpage character and identity and make users want to go on your webpage or eat your cake.</p>


<h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
<p>This means thinking of all the elements on a webpage as being inside a box. A good instance to do this is when looking at a design brief. Designers often do this by drawing boxes around all the elements. It is good to start with big boxes to divide the page up into different parts, and then working towards smaller boxes around individual elements like images or a heading.</p>

<h3> What is the box model?</h3>
<p>This model is comprised of four things:
Content, Padding, Border and Margin. They work like so; Margins let us push elements away from each other. Padding lets up create space internally. Border goes around the padding of the content. Content is the text, image, shape that we want to create the padding, border or margin around. This model can be viewed in Dev tools on Google Chrome, under the 'styles' tab</p>
