    <h1>Self-confidence</h1>
    <h2>8 February 2016</h2>

    <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
    <p>I think self-awareness is very similar to mindfulness, but self-awareness is paying attention to things more inwardly.</p>


    <h3>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>
    <p>I tried the Body Scan and I think it's definitely something I do subconciously when I experience strong emotions. I don't know if it helped because I wasn't experiencing any strong emotions at the time, but, like Meng said it is something that has to be practiced systematically to take effect. So maybe I'll try doing this more often, throughout the day.</p>


    <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section?</h3>
    <p>This was interesting because I understood what Meng was saying about reframing the idea of emotions from being existential to physiological. I agree that this is more accurate, but personally, I have never felt that by saying or thinking 'I am angry' I was meaning that it is an intrinsic part of my personality. However, from this angle I liked what he said about being able to 'treat' negative emotions like any bodily pain or sensation. Having mastery over emotions.</p>
