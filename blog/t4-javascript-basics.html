    <h1>Javascript basics</h1>
    <h2>5 February 2016</h2>


    <h3>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>

    <p>To put it simply, it's much more complicated. The purpose and function HTML and CSS is alot more straightforward. Javascript concepts are tricky but I find it harder to understand the purpose of certain concepts. E.g. when would I want to use a loop or an array on my page? I find it difficult to contextualise what I've been learning about Javascript.</p>

    <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'</h3>
    <p>From what I've gathered, control flow determines the order in which tasks in the code are performed. So, for example, if I remember my first aid correctly, if you get a cut you should:
    1. stop any bleeding
    2. clean the wound
    3. protect wound with bandage/plaster
    any variations to this general process (which could very well happen) are represented using if/else statements. E.g. if your cut is very deep you will call an ambulance.
    Loops go through data until a condition is met. Sometimes the amount of repetition is known and can be specified in the code, and sometimes it is not known and we use a while loop. So to apply it to this increasingly grusome analogy, while your cut is spurting profusely with blood you'll have to keep putting preasure on the wound until the paramedics arrive. Which could be any amount of time.</p>

    <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</h3>

    <p>When accessing data from arrays you need to use bracket notation to specify the exact bit (or bits) of data you want to access e.g. for an array called 'fruitSalad' you'd access multiple bit of data from it using numbers like this fruitSalad[0,4]. This is because the position of data in arrays is fixed and have a 0 based index, meaning the bits of data are numbered from 0,1,2,3 and so on.
    Whereas accessing data from an object literal requires you to specify the data using dot notation e.g. fruitSalad.mango or, bracket notation e.g. fruitSalad["mango"].</p>
    

    <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h3>

    <p>Functions are blocks of code which can be used repeatedly to perform a particular task. To put it simply, a function takes in inputs, does something to them and produces an output, e.g. taking and input of a name from the user and returning a full sentence including the user's name.</p>
