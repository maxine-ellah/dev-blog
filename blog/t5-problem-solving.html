    <h1>Problem solving</h1>
    <h2>14 February 2016</h2>


<h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you
1. Got blocked on a simple problem
2. Solved a problem in an elegant way
In both cases:</h3>

 <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
 <p>My very first step to making the racer game was to figure out how to move an 'active' class from one tag to another using javascript.</p>

 <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
 <p>I googled so damn much and got some great tips on stackoverflow.
 For this particular problem I had to get a better understanding of for loops for counting through the tags and selectors to target the right elements. I asked alot of really basic questions on stackoverflow to understand these things as thoroghly as I could.</p>
 <br>
 <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
 <p>Really insecure to be perfectly honest. I know I'm not supposed to know everything about javascript but I really struggled with the fact that I wasn't taking in all the information that I had previously learned about javascript and had to rely alot on other people's advice and code. However I think this process really made me look at heaps of code and (kind of) understand the core of common statements.</p>


<h4>Psuedocode</h4>
<p>I understand this but I haven't really used it in my game.</p>
 
 <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
 <p>This was actually really helpful to me. I literally HAD to talk to myself to understand certain functions.</p>
 <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
 <p>Yes I understand these and they are very helpful for debugging.</p>
 <h4>Console.logging</h4>
 <p>I understand and feel confident with this</p>
 <h4>Googling</h4>
 <p>I LOVE asking google for help </p>
 <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
 <p>I LOVE asking my cohort for help. Super attentive!</p>
 <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
 <p>I'm not quite there with this. It's been a manic week and I haven't had the energy to think back about things in any detail.</p> 

 <h4>.map()</h4>
 <p>This applies a function to multiple elements in an array and then puts the outcomes into a new array.<p>
 <h4>.filter() </h4>
 <p>This literally filters the contents of the array through a funtion to produce a new list (array) of values which are true in the function e.g. .filter() with % 5 == 0 would test all the numbers in an array and all the ones divisible by 5 would be put in the new array.</p>
 <h4>.reduce()</h4>
 <p>As far as I can understand this applies a function to (or adds up) the contents of the array from left to right, so that one value is left.</p>
