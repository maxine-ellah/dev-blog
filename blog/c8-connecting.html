Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?

Try empathic listening - how did it go?



How did you find the loving kindness meditation?
Fine, it was quite predictable. I think you're inevitably going to feel connected and empathetic towards someone you care about and probably already hope for positive things for them, at least, I do.

Situation: I once worked as a receptionist and during the office shift my manager assigned me the job of packing everything in the office that wasn't spoken for and to then organise all these things in the new office. Needless to say, there was a shitload of stuff to deal with.

My perspective:
I felt extremely exploited and completely overworked during this period (which was over a period of weeks) because the work I was doing was well beyond my receptionist duties. 
This was a job that should have been assigned to a team of people, from actual movers to pack up the stuff in the old office, to the whole organisational staff to help unpack and reorganise it in the new one. It should not have been solely my responsibiity.
I should also mention, this was all on top of my regular every day duties.

Manager's perspective:
The organisation had just undergone a big management transition and under this new management I was under some pressure to manage the office shift in as cost effective a way as possible. And, seen as I had Maxine as an administrator I thought it would be appropriate to assign her the job of packing and reorganising all the leftover things in the office. I also knew that Maxine would be leaving in a couple of weeks, so I felt like I should utilise her organisational skills in as effective a way as possible before she left.

Any other musings?
