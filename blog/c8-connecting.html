Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?
I find the whole assume everyone is good until proven otherwise is a mentality I've tried to foster thoughout my life. In some moments in life it is definitely harder to maintain this attitude towards people (e.g. if you're going through a stressful time, or you've recently been let down or hurt) and I've found it a lot easier to think of people in this way when I'm generally happy in life. Thinking about this made me think about when I was a child and how being much more naive in life made me have this attitude to pretty much everyone I met back then and how easily friends are made when we're young because youre way less aware of people's negative traits.

Anyway, a bit of a waffle. I haven't specifically used the techniques mentioned in the chapter and I haven't really taken note of whether people are more drawn or trusting of me when i have fostered this attitude but, personally, I find I enjoy being around people who are not judgemental and do not harbour negative assumptions about others, and being around that type of energy definitely makes me happy and sets me at ease. and that makes me want be good and non judgemental to others too.
 


Try empathic listening - how did it go?



How did you find the loving kindness meditation?
Fine, it was quite predictable. I think you're inevitably going to feel connected and empathetic towards someone you care about and probably already hope for positive things for them, at least, I do.


Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing
Situation: I once worked as a receptionist and during the office shift my manager assigned me the job of packing everything in the office that wasn't spoken for and to then organise all these things in the new office. Needless to say, there was a shitload of stuff to deal with.

My perspective:
I felt extremely exploited and completely overworked during this period (which was over a period of weeks) because the work I was doing was well beyond my receptionist duties. 
This was a job that should have been assigned to a team of people, from actual movers to pack up the stuff in the old office, to the whole organisational staff to help unpack and reorganise it in the new one. It should not have been solely my responsibiity.
I should also mention, this was all on top of my regular every day duties.

Manager's perspective:
The organisation had just undergone a big management transition and under this new management I was under some pressure to manage the office shift in as cost effective a way as possible. And, seen as I had Maxine as an administrator I thought it would be appropriate to assign her the job of packing and reorganising all the leftover things in the office. I also knew that Maxine would be leaving in a couple of weeks, so I felt like I should utilise her organisational skills in as effective a way as possible before she left.
