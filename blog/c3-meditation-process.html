How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?

God, it was bloody hard! Because I like things to look appealing to the eye, I found I had to divorce myself from the idea that that is what makes a website good. I found myself often fast forwarding to the design process before I had even implemented certain functional elements! So it defintely made me aware of my habits.

What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?

It's definitely something I've been interested in trying to help with stress reduction and concentration, but I really didn't know that much about it. 

What new things have you learnt about mediation?
The video had some really insightful ideas; I liked the concept of the attitude you have towards distractions being important in the meditation process and that having a kind, curious and empathetic attitude is what helps strengthen concentration. Also, the pattern of acknowledging, experiencing without judging and letting go of distractions was quite helpful and I want to try and implement that when I'm working.


Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?
Not really to be honest. Meng made it seem pretty much up to the individual; any way that helps you maintain alertness and relaxation.

Any other musings?
The cognitive perspective taking concept was really interesting; the idea of being able to 'make room' in your mind to take the perspective of others. I just really liked the idea of this being something you can keep betting better at and not worrying so much about your own thoughts. It seems like a nice idea to be able to put yourself in other people's shoes more and sweating the small stuff in your life less.
