    <h1>Meditation</h1>
    <h2>29 January 2016</h2>

    <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
    <p>God, it was bloody hard! Because I like things to look appealing to the eye, I found I had to divorce myself from the idea that that is what makes a website good. I found myself often fast forwarding to the design process before I had even implemented certain functional elements! So it defintely made me aware of my habits.</p>

    <h3>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
    <p>It's definitely something I've been interested in trying to help with stress reduction and concentration, but I really didn't know that much about it.</p> 

    <h3>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h3>
    <p>The video had some really insightful ideas; I liked the concept of the attitude you have towards distractions being important in the meditation process and that having a kind, curious and empathetic attitude is what helps strengthen concentration. Also, the pattern of acknowledging, experiencing without judging and letting go of distractions was quite helpful and I want to try and implement that when I'm working.</p>


    <h3>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
    <p>Not really to be honest. Meng made it seem pretty much up to the individual; any way that helps you maintain alertness and relaxation.</p>

    <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
    <p>The cognitive perspective taking concept was really interesting; the idea of being able to 'make room' in your mind to take the perspective of others. I just really liked the idea of this being something you can keep betting better at and not worrying so much about your own thoughts. It seems like a nice idea to be able to put yourself in other people's shoes more and sweating the small stuff in your life less.</p>
