    <h1>Control/Self-regulation</h1>
    <h2>17 February 2016</h2>

    <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
    <p>I found the idea of choice quite interesting and I really liked the Marcus Aurelius quote which said that distress is caused by our perception of the thing and that we can 'revoke' that perception, thus giving ourselves the ability to regulate emotions during difficult times. I thought this idea of choice was also nicely reflected in the quote "Power to let go is the source of choice."
    I thought about how panicked I tend to get in difficult situations and I find it hard to imagine 'reframing' things in those moments or choosing between getting worked up or just 'letting go', but I'm optimistic that you can change the way your brain works so, self-regulation is something I want to at least be more aware of during those moments.</p>

    <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
    <p>I didn't practice this particular exercise (wasn't mentioned in the chapter) but I have paid more attention to my emotions as I've been working over the last few weeks. I just don't know if I've felt any different as a result.</p>
