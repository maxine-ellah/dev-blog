Marcella Hazan's tomato sauce (A.K.A. the most famous tomato sauce da the internet)

I'm making pasta for dinner tonight and I'm going to give my regular garlic-heavy tomato sauce a rest and give this one a go. I heard about it a few years ago but was reluctant to try it because I couldn't be arsed to boil (let alone buy) 1kg of fresh tomatoes. But, I've recently found myself inundated with them from my inlaws' garden and I thought, "well, what better excuse crack open that new block of pam's parmesan cheese?".
That said, you can totally make this with canned toms instead of fresh ones (I totally plan to next time).

The beauty of this sauce is it's damn simplicity.
