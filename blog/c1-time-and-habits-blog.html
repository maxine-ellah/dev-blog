<h1>Time and Habits</h1>

    <h2>14 January 2016</h2>
    <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>

    <p>I set my timer to one hour and focused solely on the task for that time and tried to stay away from my phone.
      
    </p>
    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>

    <p>
      I related alot to the idea of 'The resistance' and not wanting to take risks in my work and the fear of making a mistake or 'standing out' and trying to silence those thoughts.
      I also liked the idea of creating little habits to change your behaviour permanently. It reminded me of the idea of neuroplasticity which I read a book on ages ago, and I like thinking that we are completely capable of changing the way we think and learning new things throughout our lives.
    </p>

    <h3>What worked for you? </h3>
    <p>
      Knowing my limits for staying focused on one thing is definitely an important factor for me. Although I timeboxed for and hour, I found it quite challenging to stay focused for that long, so next time I think I will try timeboxing for 30-45 minutes at a time. Taking breaks is also very important!
    </p>

    <h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>

    <p>
     I'd like to pay more attention to how long I tend to spend on certain tasks, so I can more accurately timebox my time. 
     making little habits based on already established behaviours is something I tried a few months ago and it worked quite well, so I will try and incorporate that into my work too.
