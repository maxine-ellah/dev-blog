    <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>

      <p>
        Grid based design lays out a webpage in a way which takes advantage of patterns our eyes naturally follow when we look at something. It breaks up the content on a webpage into different sections, which makes a grid.

    <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>

      <p>
        It's very useful because it means that a webpage will respond to the size of the screen it is being viewed through and resize accordingly, making all the content look good ledgible not matter what device it is being veiwed through.
        This is pretty essential today because today people access the internet primarily through their phones or tablets.

    <h3>Semantic structure</h3>

      <p>
        Semantic tags label content in a way that is easy to read and understand when seen in HTML. The use of sementic tags usually comes after creating a general overarching structure for the page. Using Semantic tags allows you to get more specific in how you structure your content and to structure smaller bits of content within certain boxes.
      </p>

    <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on</h3>

      <p>
        It was good to hear about the importance of negative space because it is a really simple thing which greatly improves the readability of a page. This part also helped me understand exactly what margins and padding do. Margins let us push elements away from each other and padding creates space internally.
