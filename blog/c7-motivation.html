    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <h2>25 February 2016</h2>

    <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>

    <p>Gosh, he makes it all so sound so easy!
    To be honest the only thing that made much sense to me was the very end when Meng says "you have to feel stupid in order to do amazing things." I found that funny and quite comforting because, if I'm sure about one thing, it's that I feel stupid all the time doing this course! I think he's also talking about needing to get outside of your comfort zone to get the courage to do great things.
    But in regards to the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' thing, i didn't really relate to his way of looking at things in varying levels of attainment. Who really does?</p> 

    <h3>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,
    What are your core values?</h3>
    <p>It sounds a bit random written down, but two things which seem to be recurring in my life are 1. to treat others how I'd like to be treated/treat everyone with respect/put myself in other people's shoes and 2. to look after my body in whatever way I can, because you only get one!
    I'm not sure how these will manifest themselves in the future, but hey!</p>

    <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
    <p>I thought it was quite true what Meng said about people wanting to be inspired by goodnes i.e. if you have a good idea generally people will be keen to help you out. Which I think was a good step to gaining the 'inner calm' he mentioned the the resilience exercise, because it took away scariness of the idea of failure; like, the world is not out to witness your downfall, Maxine.</p>
